# Requirements

Atari STE or Mega STE with at least 1MB RAM  
Color or monochrome monitor  
ACSI or IDE Hard Drive


# Contents

- asm  
Contains the player in 68000 assembler code for Atari STE.

- BASTGenerator  
Data files generator in C#. To regenerate the files you'll also need the audio/video assets available here:  
https://fenarinarsa.com/badapple/fenarinarsa_badapple_source.zip  
...and Visual Studio (any edition).


# Build instructions

You need the following tools:  
- vasm (cross-platform) or Devpac (ST)  
- make (the GNU/Linux tool)  

## vasm

For Windows I offer you my vasm 1.8 binary here (else you need to compile it from source code):  
https://fenarinarsa.com/demos/vasm_mot_1.8.zip  
Official site with source code:  
http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/

And add vasm's path to the environment PATH variable. 

## make

The fastest way to install make on Windows is to install chocolatey:  
https://chocolatey.org/  
Then open a shell as administrator and type:  
`choco install make`

## Build

To build ba.tos, open a shell, go to the "asm" folder and type:  
`make`

You will get a ba.tos that works with the 50kHz color version.

The data files can be found in the final release:

## Options

### Alternate versions

Don't forget to use the correct data files (they're all provided in the release archive):
- You can switch to monochrome by setting ```monochrome EQU 1``` at the start of the source code.  
- The DMA sound frequency can be easily changed (look for ```move.b #%11,$FFFF8921.w```). 

### STF/TT030/Falcon ports

It's worth noting that you can disable the blitter use in BASTGenerator by setting all three ```opt_blitter``` options to ```false``` in ```bw_MakeRun()```. The generated data file will only contain software code for delta-packing without any need to change the player. By using only 8 greyshades and adding a software YM2149 sample replay, an STF version should be possible.  

The Blitter emulation provided in the source code should work on 68030 (untested). However the "stack trick" used between interrupts is not compatible with the 68030, to my knowledge.

A Falcon version could also be done by removing all audio data and using an MP2 player. However the 4/3 resolutions are different in VGA and RGB, and the Videl chip needs to be setup accordingly to work in 60Hz.
